# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023 - Week 1

## Fixing Tags

[How to Delete Local and Remote Tags on Git](https://devconnected.com/how-to-delete-local-and-remote-tags-on-git/)

Local delete a tag
```sh
git tag -d <tag_name>
```

Remotely delete tag

```sh
git push --delete origin tagname
```

Checkout the commit that you want to retag. Grab the sha from your Github history.

```sh
git checkout <SHA>
git tag M.M.P
git push --tags
git checkout main
```

## Root Module Structure

Our root module structure is as follows:

```
PROJECT_ROOT
│
├── main.tf                 # everything else.
├── variables.tf            # stores the structure of input variables
├── terraform.tfvars        # the data of variables we want to load into our terraform project
├── providers.tf            # defined required providers and their configuration
├── outputs.tf              # stores our outputs
└── README.md               # required for root modules
```

[Standard Module Structure](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/develop/structure)

## Terraform and Input Variables

### Terraform Cloud Variables

In terraform we can set two kind of variables:
- Enviroment Variables - those you would set in your bash terminal eg. AWS credentials
- Terraform Variables - those that you would normally set in your tfvars file

We can set Terraform Cloud variables to be sensitive so they are not shown visibliy in the UI.

### Loading Terraform Input Variables

[Terraform Input Variables](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables)

### var flag
We can use the `-var` flag to set an input variable or override a variable in the tfvars file eg. `terraform -var user_ud="my-user_id"`

### var-file flag

- TODO: document this flag
- DONE
The `-var-file` flag in is used to specify a file from which to read input variables. This allows you to define a set of variables in a separate file rather than specifying them directly on the command line. For example:

```sh
terraform apply -var-file=my-vars.tfvars

```
where my-vars.tfvars is a file containing variable definitions in JSON or HCL format.

### terraform.tvfars

The `terraform.tfvars` file is a default file that Terraform automatically loads to provide variable values. This file allows you to define variable values in a key-value pair format without having to specify them on the command line.

Here's an example of how you can structure a `terraform.tfvars` file:

```sh
# terraform.tfvars

region = "us-west-2"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
ami = "ami-12345678"
```
In this example, we've defined three variables: `region`, `instance_type`, and `ami`, along with their corresponding values.

When you run `terraform plan` or `terraform apply` without specifying variable values through flags or other methods, Terraform will automatically load the values from this `terraform.tfvars` file if it exists in the working directory.

This provides a convenient way to organize and manage your variable values, especially when dealing with multiple variables and configurations. Remember to handle sensitive information carefully and avoid storing sensitive data directly in this file.


### auto.tfvars

- TODO: document this functionality for terraform cloud
- **DONE**
The `auto.tfvars` file is automatically loaded by Terraform, if present in the current directory, without the need to explicitly specify it. Terraform will automatically load variables from this file and apply them. This file can contain variable definitions in JSON or HCL format.

### order of terraform variables

- TODO: document which terraform variables takes presendence.
- **DONE**
When it comes to the order of precedence for Terraform variables, the hierarchy is as follows:

1. **Environment Variables (`TF_VAR_name`):**
Variables set using the `TF_VAR_name` environment variable have the highest precedence. For example, `TF_VAR_region=us-west-2`

2. **Variable Definitions in Files (`-var and -var-file`):**
Variables specified using the `-var` flag or `-var-file` flag while running **terraform** commands. These can be in JSON or HCL format.

3. **Terraform Configuration Files (`*.tf and *.tfvars`):**
Variables defined within the Terraform configuration files (`.tf`) and variable files (`.tfvars`). These can be overridden by other methods if the same variable is defined multiple times.

4. **Defaults in Variable Definitions:**
Default values specified in the variable definitions in the Terraform configuration files.


## Dealing With Configuration Drift

## What happens if we lose our state file?

If you lose your statefile, you must likely have to tear down all your cloud infrastructures manually.

You can use terraform import but it won't work for all cloud resources. You need to check the terraform providers documentation for which resources that support import.

### Fix Missing Resources with Terraform Import

`terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket bucket-name`

[Terraform Import](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import)
[AWS S3 Bucket Import](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket#import)

### Fix Manual Configuration

If someone goes and delete or modifies cloud resource manually through ClickOps. 

If we run Terraform plan with attempt to put our infrastructure back into the expected state fixing Configuration Drift

## Fix using Terraform Refresh

```sh
terraform apply -refresh-only -auto-approve
```

## Terraform Modules

### Terraform Module Structure

It is recommended to place modules in a `modules` directory when locally developing modules but you can name it whatever you like.

### Passing Input Variables

We can pass input variables to our module.
The module has to declare the terraform variables in its own variables.tf

```tf
module "terrahouse_aws" {
  source = "./modules/terrahouse_aws"
  user_uuid = var.user_uuid
  bucket_name = var.bucket_name
}
```

### Modules Sources

Using the source we can import the module from various places eg:
- locally
- Github
- Terraform Registry

```tf
module "terrahouse_aws" {
  source = "./modules/terrahouse_aws"
}
```

## Considerations when using ChatGPT to write Terraform

LLMs such as ChatGPT may not be trained on the latest documentation or information about Terraform.

It may likely produce older examples that could be deprecated. Often affecting providers.

## Working with Files in Terraform


### Fileexists function

This is a built in terraform function to check the existance of a file.

```tf
condition = fileexists(var.error_html_filepath)
```

https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/fileexists

### Filemd5

https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/filemd5

### Path Variable

In terraform there is a special variable called `path` that allows us to reference local paths:
- path.module = get the path for the current module
- path.root = get the path for the root module
[Special Path Variable](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/references#filesystem-and-workspace-info)


resource "aws_s3_object" "index_html" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.website_bucket.bucket
  key    = "index.html"
  source = "${path.root}/public/index.html"
}

## Terraform Locals

Locals allows us to define local variables.
It can be very useful when we need transform data into another format and have referenced a variable.

```tf
locals {
  s3_origin_id = "MyS3Origin"
}
```
[Local Values](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/locals)

## Terraform Data Sources

This allows us to source data from cloud resources.

This is useful when we want to reference cloud resources without importing them.

```tf
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

output "account_id" {
  value = data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id
}
```
[Data Sources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/data-sources)

## Working with JSON

We use the jsonencode to create the json policy inline in the hcl.

```tf
> jsonencode({"hello"="world"})
{"hello":"world"}
```

[jsonencode](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/jsonencode)


## Changing the Lifecycle of Resources

[Meta Arguments Lifcycle](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle)


## Terraform Data

Plain data values such as Local Values and Input Variables don't have any side-effects to plan against and so they aren't valid in replace_triggered_by. You can use terraform_data's behavior of planning an action each time input changes to indirectly use a plain value to trigger replacement.

https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/terraform-data


## Provisioners

Provisioners allow you to execute commands on compute instances eg. a AWS CLI command.

They are not recommended for use by Hashicorp because Configuration Management tools such as Ansible are a better fit, but the functionality exists.

[Provisioners](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax)

### Local-exec

This will execute command on the machine running the terraform commands eg. plan apply

```tf
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo The server's IP address is ${self.private_ip}"
  }
}
```

https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/local-exec

### Remote-exec

This will execute commands on a machine which you target. You will need to provide credentials such as ssh to get into the machine.

```tf
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  # Establishes connection to be used by all
  # generic remote provisioners (i.e. file/remote-exec)
  connection {
    type     = "ssh"
    user     = "root"
    password = var.root_password
    host     = self.public_ip
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "puppet apply",
      "consul join ${aws_instance.web.private_ip}",
    ]
  }
}
```
https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/remote-exec


## For Each Expressions

For each allows us to enumerate over complex data types

```sh
[for s in var.list : upper(s)]
```

This is mostly useful when you are creating multiples of a cloud resource and you want to reduce the amount of repetitive terraform code.
